# Describing pin configs #

This document explains how to generate pin muxing definitions to support pin states for Espressif SoCs. Pin states are consumed by the `pinctrl` subsystem.

It is initially meant to be a reference to `hal_espressif` contributors only, though the outcomes of this work can be overlayed by Zephyr RTOS users basing its applications on our SoCs.

## Supporting a new SoC ##

When supporting a new SoC, create a _yaml_ file under `zephyr/esp_shared/pincfgs` named with the lowercased SoC name (e.g., `esp32.yml` for `ESP32`). Pin muxing information will be derived from this file to support pin states description.

Let us assume we are supporting `ESP32S2` for the first time. The following commands will do the job:

```sh
$ cd zephyr/esp_shared/pincfgs
$ vim esp32s2.yml
```

## Filling `pincfg` files ##

It is easier to explain through an example, for this purpose, let us take `ESP32`'s UART_0 to illustrate:

```yaml
uart0:
  tx:
    sigo: u0txd_out
    gpio: [[0, 21], [26, 45]]
  rx:
    sigi: u0rxd_in
    gpio: [[0, 21], [26, 46]]
```

Compare the following description of the required fields in a `{soc}.yaml` file with the above snippet. The bullet indentation follows the original file indentation.

- **`{peripheral}`** (required): concatenation of the peripheral name and its instance number (respectively, `uart` and `0` from the snippet above).
- **`{periph_sig}`** (required): freely-named field which depends on the target peripheral, `tx` and `rx` above are examples of `periph_sig`.
    - **`sigo`** (optional): output signal, required if the pin is an output.
    - **`sigi`** (optional): input signal, required if the pin is an output.
    - **`gpio`** (required): array composed of __integers__ and/or __2-sized arrays of integers__. Integer elements represent a pin number (e.g., `1` means `GPIO1`) while a 2-sized array represents a pin number range (e.g., `[0, 21]` means `GPIO0`, `GPIO1`, ... , `GPIO21`).

**NOTES**

- The values for the fields `sigi` and `sigo` must be borrowed from `include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/{soc}-gpio-sigmap.h` file. Drop the `ESP_` prefix and lowercase the result (e.g., `ESP_U0TXD_OUT` becomes `u0txd_out`).
- Though the fields `sigi` and `sigo` are optional, at least one of them must be present in the target peripheral.
- If the `gpio` field is formed by either only one pin number or only one pin number range, in any case, enclosing in `[]` is still required, remember, the script expects an array. Failing to do so, may lead to unintended states generation. For example, `[0, 19]` is **not** the same as `[[0, 19]]`. The last generates a pin range information, while the former generates for `GPIO0` and `GPIO19` only.
- The fields enclosed in `{}` should be replaced by peripheral-specific names.
- Mind the indentation.

## Generating pin muxing information ##

From `hal_espressif`'s root folder, run the script (here, using `ESP32-S2` as target):

```sh
$ ./zephyr/scripts/pinctrl/esp_genpinctrl.py -p zephyr/esp_shared/pincfgs/esp32s2.yml
```

The pin muxing definitions will be autogenerated and placed at `include/dt-bindinds/pinctrl/{soc}-pinctrl.h`.

Use those definitions on your pin states declarations.
