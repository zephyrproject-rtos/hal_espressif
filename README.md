Important Information About This Repository
*******************************************

HAL Espressif (or `hal_espressif`) is a collection of tools, low-level APIs and hardware access functions for Espressif Devices.

This repository is a copy (not a fork) of [esp-hal3rd party repository](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hal-3rdparty). If a SoC is not yet supported, work starts in `esp-hal-3rdparty`.

For any support or feature request, refer to Zephyr's [main repository](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr) instead.

In case you are looking for a way to start in Zephyr with Espressif devices, [follow this tutorial](https://www.zephyrproject.org/zephyr-rtos-on-esp32/). You don't need to do anything special to get this repository, it will come along if you follow common Zephyr guidelines.
